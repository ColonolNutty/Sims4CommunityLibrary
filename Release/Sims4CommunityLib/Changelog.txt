- The `CommonFolderPersistenceService` will now include a list of file names it found with the data from CommonFolderPersistenceService.load
- The debug interactions now display the Sim Id as well as the identifiers for each of whatever they are showing (i.e. Show Traits will now show the trait ids next to each trait)
- When using the debug interactions to print Sim data, the data is now sorted alphabetically.
- If an object is not a Sim within the init of SimDataStore, an exception will now be thrown.
- If an object is not a GameObject within the init of GameObjectDataStore, an exception will now be thrown.
- If no data is available to persist, the data will instead of removed from the data storage. This will reduce memory usage as well as json file bloat.
- When reading JSON from a folder, `.DS_Store` files will now be ignored from being read as JSON.
- Rename the ctypes_module package so its name does not conflict with any other mods
- In all code that uses the InteractionContext, the shift_held value will now be properly calculated (For Windows Users only for now. I can't test whether it works for Mac users without having a Mac)
- Updated the documentation to include many of the classes and utilities that were missing.
- **Renamed the S4CL Configuration file extension to config from json to reduce confusion**
  - Make sure you remove the previous file `sims4communitylib.json`!
