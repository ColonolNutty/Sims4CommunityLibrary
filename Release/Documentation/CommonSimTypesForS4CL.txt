The following is a list of Common Sim Types used by various mods to uniquely identify the Age, Species, and Occult Type of a Sim.

=Notes=
* Please note that anything a Non-Occult Sim Type can use or be available for the appropriate Occult Sim Type. i.e. Something available for ADULT_HUMAN will also be available for ADULT_HUMAN_VAMPIRE, but something available for ADULT_HUMAN_VAMPIRE will not be available for ADULT_HUMAN.
* Not all Sim Types are listed here, but they all match a similar pattern!
** For Occult Sim Types the pattern is <Age>_<Species>_<OccultType>. CHILD_HUMAN_ALIEN, TEEN_HUMAN_SKELETON, ELDER_LARGE_DOG_VAMPIRE, etc.
